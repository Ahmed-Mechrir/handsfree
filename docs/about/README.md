# About Handsfree.js.org

## Master Plan

1. Create a library that makes face, hand, eye, and pose tracking and voice and mind control easy to use 
2. Use the library to build a repository of custom handsfree plugins, components, and gestures
3. Use the repository to seed a "user script manager" to power a handsfree browser extension
4. Grow a community of handsfree users and developers around the library and repository
5. Start "The Handsfree Foundation" to promote creative expression
