## Properties

Each of the following can be accessed either through `handsfree.posenet.data` outside of a plugin, or through `data.posenet` when inside `onFrame(data => {})`. The alias to `posenet` is `pose`:

```js
/**
 * {Array} Keypoint confidence. Each index is an object with:
 * 
 * {part: 'name', position: {x, y}, score}
 * 
 * Where {x, y} is the pixel on the screen the keypoint is at
 * and the score is how confident the algorithm is
 */
handsfree.posenet.pose.keypoints[]

/**
 * {Number} How confident the algorithm is about the whole pose
 */
handsfree.posenet.pose.score

/**
 * {Object} Each of the above can also be accessed by name
 */
handsfree.posenet.pose.nose
