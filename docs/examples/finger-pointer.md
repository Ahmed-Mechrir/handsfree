The finger pointer estimates a ray from your index/pointer finger onto the screen. It positions a pointer there and you can use the calculated values to all sorts of things which we'll explore!

```js
const handsfree = new Handsfree({face: true})
handsfree.start()

// Where on the screen to position the pointer
handsfree.hand.data.pointer.x
handsfree.hand.data.pointer.y
```

## Plugins used
