## Using the WebXR Emulator

After installing the extension you should now see the <kbd>WebXR</kbd> tab in your Dev Tools. In order for this to work, the WebXR tab must be opened as it's what contains the scripts that reads your heads pose.

1. Set this field to the device you'd like to emulate
2. Click the <kbd>Start Handsfree</kbd> to actually start handsfree mode
