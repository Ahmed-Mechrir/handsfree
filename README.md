# NPM Quickstart

> ðŸš¨ This will be improved soon!

I switched over from Parcel to Rollup for package management and am still new to it. For now, a little extra setup is needed when installing through npm:

- Install with: `npm i handsfree`
- Copy this project's `/public/assets` folder into your own projects public folder (this makes the computer vision models accessible to your app)
- When instantiating `Handsfree`, set the `assetsPath` property to where you moved the assets into:

```js
import Handsfree from 'handsfree'
const handsfree = new Handsfree({
  weboji: true,
  assetsPath: '/public/assets/'
})
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

# Getting Started

## Instantiating

Once you've included Handsfree.js into your project you'll have a global `Handsfree` class in the `window`'s scope. You'll want to create one instance for every webcam you intend to use, along with some configs.

```js
// Instantiate with the weboji face tracker with defaults
let handsfree = new Handsfree({weboji: true})

// ...or...

// Instantiate and configure the face tracker
// - The following are all defaults (feel free to skip some)
handsfree = new Handsfree({
  // Where the files are
  assetsPath: document.currentScript.getAttribute('src') + '/assets/',

  /**
   * Used to show the webcam feed along with basic debug info
   */
  feedback: {
    enabled: false,
    
    // Where to inject the feedback canvas
    $target: document.body
  },

  /**
   * Face tracker
   */
  weboji: {
    // All models are disabled by default!
    enabled: false,
    
    // How many milliseconds to wait between detections
    // - Use to help improve UI performance on slower devices
    throttle: 0,
    
    // Represents the calibrator settings
    // - Minimal CSS styles are provided
    calibrator: {
      // The target element to act as the calibrator wrapping div
      // - automatically created if null
      target: null,
      
      // The message to display over the marker, can be HTML
      instructions: 'Point head towards center of circle below',

      // The target element to act as the calibrator target (should be inside target)
      // - optional if .target === null, otherwise required
      marker: null
    },

    // The confidence (between 0 and 1) required for various face morphs before
    // they are considered activated
    morphs: {
      threshold: {
        smileRight: 0.7,
        smileLeft: 0.7,
        browLeftDown: 0.8,
        browRightDown: 0.8,
        browLeftUp: 0.8,
        browRightUp: 0.8,
        eyeLeftClosed: 0.4,
        eyeRightClosed: 0.4,
        mouthOpen: 0.3,
        mouthRound: 0.8,
        upperLip: 0.5
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Once you've instantiated `Handsfree` you can start and stop it with:

```js
handsfree = new Handsfree({weboji: true})
handsfree.start()

// Currently this just reloads the page
handsfree.stop()
```

## Adding Functionality

By default, the `weboji` face tracker comes bundled with a set of plugins. Plugins add functionality that can be toggled on/off, which is useful when working on complex applications that require different gestures for different views. Plugins can also be overwritten.

Plugins are added with the `handsfree.use('myPlugin', opts)`:

```js
handsfree = new Handsfree({weboji: true})

handsfree.use('myPlugin', {
  // All plugins are true by default
  enabled: true,

  // A set of config values that can be overwritten
  config: {},

  // Called on every single webcam frame
  onFrame (data) {},

  // Called immediate after this plugin is added
  onUse (handsfree) {},

  // Called when the plugin is enabled from a disabled state
  // eg, after calling: handsfree.plugin.myPlugin.enable()
  onEnable (handsfree) {},

  // Called when the plugin is disabled from an enabled state
  // eg, after calling: handsfree.plugin.myPlugin.disable()
  onDisable (handsfree) {}
})
```

You can also pass a function as the second argument, which is assigned to the `.onFrame` callback:

```js
// This...
handsfree.use('myPlugin', data => {
  console.log(data.weboji.data.morphs)
})

// ...is similar to this
handsfree.use('myPlugin', {
  onFrame: data => {
    console.log(data.weboji.data.morphs)
  }
})
```

The `onFrame` method, which is called on every webcam frame, receives a `data` object containing data for each active model...`data.weboji` for Face Tracking and `data.posenet` for Pose Estimation. If you're only using one model, then it's usually easier to destructure:

```js
// This
handsfree.use('myPlugin', {weboji} => {
  console.log(weboji.data)
})

// Instead of this
handsfree.use('myPlugin', data => {
  console.log(data.weboji.data)
})
```

See `/src/demo` and `/src/handsfree/plugins` for examples (simpler ones will be made soon)!

## Removing Functionality

You can disable all the pre-packaged plugins with `handsfree.disablePlugins()` or by passing a list of plugin names to disable with `handsfree.disablePlugins(['pluginName'])` or just a string with `handsfree.disablePlugins('pluginName')`.

You can also just delete the plugin with `delete handsfree.plugin['pluginName']`

## Weboji - Face Tracker

Each of the following can be accessed either through `handsfree.weboji.data` outside of a plugin, or through `data.weboji.data` when inside `onFrame`.

### Properties

```js
/**
 * {Array} Face morphs, from 0 (not activated) to 1 (fully activated)
 * 
 * 0: smileRight â†’ closed mouth smile right
 * 1: smileLeft â†’ closed mouth smile left

 * - Scale refers to the size of the head in relation to the webcam frame
 */
handsfree.weboji.data.translation

 */
handsfree.weboji.data.pointer

/**
 * {Object} Helper booleans checking if the morph has reached a threshold

 */
handsfree.weboji.data.state
```

### Methods

Please see the [Weboji Docs](https://github.com/jeeliz/jeelizWeboji/blob/master/doc/jeefacetransferAPI.pdf) to see available methods exposed through `handsfree.weboji.api`:

```js
// Check if the head is detected or not
handsfree.weboji.api.is_detected()
```

## PoseNet - Pose Estimation

> ðŸš¨ Please note: The PoseNet integration will be overhauled soon. It's not recommended to use it in production in it's current state

### Properties

Each of the following can be accessed either through `handsfree.posenet.data` outside of a plugin, or through `data.posenet.data` when inside onFrame.

```js
/**
 * {Array} Keypoint confidence. Each index is an object with:
 * 
 * {part: 'name', position: {x, y}, score}
 * 
 * Where {x, y} is the pixel on the screen the keypoint is at
 * and the score is how confident the algorithm is
 */
handsfree.posenet.pose.keypoints[]

/**
 * {Number} How confident the algorithm is about the whole pose
 */
handsfree.posenet.pose.score

/**
 * {Object} Each of the above can also be accessed by name
 */
handsfree.posenet.pose.nose

handsfree.posenet.pose.leftAnkle
handsfree.posenet.pose.leftEar
handsfree.posenet.pose.leftElbow
handsfree.posenet.pose.leftEye
handsfree.posenet.pose.leftHip
handsfree.posenet.pose.leftKnee
handsfree.posenet.pose.leftShoulder
handsfree.posenet.pose.leftWrist

handsfree.posenet.pose.rightAnkle
handsfree.posenet.pose.rightEar
handsfree.posenet.pose.rightElbow
handsfree.posenet.pose.rightEye
handsfree.posenet.pose.rightHip
handsfree.posenet.pose.rightKnee
handsfree.posenet.pose.rightShoulder
handsfree.posenet.pose.rightWrist
```

### Methods

The [PoseNet API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet) is available through `handsfree.posenet.api`.

## Toggling the plugin on/off

You can use the `.disable` and `.enable` methods of a plugin to toggle them on/off. If a plugin has a `.onDisable` or `.onEnable` then the corresponding method will be called.

```js
handsfree.use('myPlugin', {
  onEnable () {console.log('enabled ðŸ˜€')},
  onDisable () {console.log('disabled ðŸ˜ž')}
})

handsfree.plugin.myPlugin.enable()
// console: enabled ðŸ˜€

handsfree.plugin.myPlugin.disable()
// console: disabled ðŸ˜ž
```
