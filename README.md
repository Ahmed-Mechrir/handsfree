# HTML Quickstart

For more code examples, check out the `/demo/` folder or try them out on Glitch:
- [Glitch Sourcecode](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/handsfree-minimal-examples?path=README.md)
- [Glitch live demo](https://handsfree-minimal-examples.glitch.me/)

```html
<!-- Require dependencies, which adds Handsfree to global namespace -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/handsfree@7.0.3/dist/handsfree.js"
/>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/handsfree@7.0.3/dist/handsfree.js"></script>

<!-- Instantiate Handsfree.js -->
<script>
  // Create a new instance. Use one instance for each camera
  const handsfree = new Handsfree({ weboji: true })

  // Create a plugin that logs head rotation
  handsfree.use('consoleLogger', ({ weboji }) => {
    if (weboji.pointer.state === 'mousedown') {
      console.log(`Clicked at: (${weboji.pointer.x}, ${weboji.pointer.y})`)
      console.log('Clicked on:', weboji.pointer.$target)
    }
  })
</script>

<!-- Start webcam on user input -->

# NPM Quickstart

I switched over from Parcel to Rollup for package management and am still new to it. For now, a little extra setup is needed when installing through npm:

- Install with: `npm i handsfree`
- Copy this project's `/public/assets` folder into your own projects public folder (this makes the computer vision models accessible to your app)
- When instantiating `Handsfree`, set the `assetsPath` property:

```js
import Handsfree from 'handsfree'
const handsfree = new Handsfree({
  weboji: true,
  assetsPath: document.location.origin + '/assets/'
})
```

# ðŸ“† Oct 2020 Update

I rewrote Handsfree.js earlier this Spring but never got around to documenting it before stopping for some time. I'm a little behind ðŸ˜… but I'm working on the project again and will document, address issues, and setup new milestones over the coming weeks as I integrate Handsfree.js into my other project [Midiblocks](https://github.com/midiblocks/midiblocks) (a handsfree creative coding IDE).

Thanks for your patience and also for the support!

## Milestones:
- [ ] Document all new APIs, including gesture recorder, calibrator, new Plugin API, etc
- [ ] Move documentation to midiblocks.com/handsfree
- [ ] Create new experiments and starter kits on Glitch.com
- [ ] "Officially" re-launch the library

# Motivation

In 2018, I became friends with another resident at Doreen's Place, a [veteran's homeless shelter](https://www.tprojects.org/) in Portland, OR that I had been living at (this was during my 2nd year there). This person was there recovering from a stroke, and after getting to know him I learned that he was depressed because he couldn't really communicate with others as he couldn't speak clearly or use a mobile device.

I was already studying machine learning at this time, as I was trying to develop a "digital assistant" for the homeless to help those waiting for social work. I was aware of [Experiments with Google](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai) and after poking around came across their first [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) project, which I used to move a pointer around:
